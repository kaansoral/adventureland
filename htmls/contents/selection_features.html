		After 10,000 digital copy sales, going to open source the game. I hope the game will act as a boilerplate for new MMORPG's with unexplored / unique dynamics.

	<div class="infop">
		Thanks to Reddit, our community grew significantly. Received lots and lots of positive and constructive feedback. <div style="margin-bottom: 6px"></div> Until December, planning to shape the game accordingly. Right now my priority is Moderation + Code. You can expect improvements every single day. Please excuse the occasional server updates. I know getting interrupted isn't fun ;]

	<div class="infot">The Plan <span style='color:#C82F17'>MUST READ!</span></div>
	<div class="infop">
		As you all know, the game is a working prototype. With all your positive feedback and suggestions, I'm now heavily working on the next stage of the game. New monsters, new bosses, new NPC's, new, more beautiful pixel items + More. And most importantly, a finalised Code system with a Tutorial that will show everyone how fun Code'ing can be!
		<div style="margin-bottom: 6px"></div>
		What does this mean for you?
		<div style="margin-bottom: 6px"></div>
		Simply put, you have to wait at least 3 weeks for new content to arrive. My hard-deadline is December 10th, soft-deadline is November 20th. In the meantime, enjoy what's already available! :)

	<div class="infop">
		Working on new maps, zones, caves, dungeons that you can get lost in. Thanks to all the feedback from the early players, the consensus is to add more adventure.

		Soon there will be hourly server-wide events. First one of these events will be "Goo Brawl", where everyone is teleported to a small island for 5 minutes to slay these Super Goo's with Super Drops :]

	<div class="infop">
		Adventure Land is super early access right now, the aim is to just develop a unique mmorpg experience and extend beyond that. If skills are added, they will extend the class, add something unique to it, balance it against other classes.{# Like MOBA skills, few but useful.#}
